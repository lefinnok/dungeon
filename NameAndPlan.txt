Plan(Written by Lee Sin Wing):

Make a trpg game (use words and commands to fight,all scenes will be output to the terminal.

Expected content:
-user run the game by typing ./io
-the game prints out some welcome words(e.g Hello adventurers....)
-the game asks the user to type in the username (e.g Sorry I forget what is your name, can you say it again?) and user inputs the username and presses enter
-the game opens the saveload file and check if the username is there, 
 If yes then print out "Hi xxxx, here is your stuff" and print out his stat as well as last time's progress
 If no, print out "sorry I can't find your name on my list, would you like to introduce yourself?" and print out "can I have your name?".
 The user inputs the preferred username and the input will be added to the saveload file. It will also add the basic stat to the user's save 
-The game prints out the user
